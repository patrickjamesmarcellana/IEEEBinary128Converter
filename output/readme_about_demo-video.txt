The demo video is uploaded in this folder, but since the file is too big, you will have to download it locally on your computer. Alternatively, you can view and play the Demo Video on GitHub itself through the README section of this repository (i.e., main repo page). Just scroll down to find the video. 

As another alternative, it can viewed in YouTube through this Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbLP0B4on_g
